You can only send two words to your partner at a time, but you must still try to convey what is happening in each scene.  </p> \n<br></br>\n\n<p class="blocktext"> For each scene, your partner will be able to see an initial set of possible participants (the presentation scene): </p>\n\n<div>\n<img src="expose.jpg" height=200>\n</div>\n\n<br></br>\n<p class="blocktext">However, they won\'t be able to see the actual action that takes place (the action scene) or the description sentence:  </p>\n\n<div>\n<img src="action.jpg" height=200>\n</div>\n<h4>"The monkey smells the orange."</h4>\n\n<p class="blocktext">Your job is to let them know what happens in the action scene using just two of the words from the description. Again, you can use only two words to respond.  Your responses will be timed.  </p>\n<br></br>\n\n<p class="blocktext">After you give your answers for all 12 scenes, you will be asked a short followup question about each scene. </p>\n<br></br>\n\n\n<p class="blocktext"><i> This is a SNAZZY POTATO SURVEY.

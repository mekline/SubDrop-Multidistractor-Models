Instructions

In this task, you will be talking with Elmo.  Elmo has a short attention span, so he can only listen to two words at a time.  In each scene, Elmo will see the actors, but will run away and miss the action taking place.  When he returns, your job is to tell him what happened.  Again, you can use only two words.  Your responses will be timed.

<h3> Part 2</h3>
<p class="blocktext"> Next you will answer a short question about each of the actions you saw during the communication game. </p> 
<br></br>

<p class="blocktext"> You will see a group of people, animals or objects.  Each set will be paired with an action word. </p>
<br></br>

<p class="blocktext"> Your job is to report <b> how surprising </b> it would be for that action to happen <b> TO </b> of the members of the group. For instance, if your word was SMELL and you saw
the group below:</p>

<center><table cellpadding=10>
<tr><td><img src=http://tedlab.mit.edu/~mekline/MDPictures/lion.jpg width=150></td>
<td><img src=http://tedlab.mit.edu/~mekline/MDPictures/tiger.jpg width=150></td>
</tr>
</table></center>

<p class="blocktext">You should report <b> how surprising it would be for someone to smell a tiger or a lion </b>, NOT how surprising it would be for a tiger or lion to smell something. </p>

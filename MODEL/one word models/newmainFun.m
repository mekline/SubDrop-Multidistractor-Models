%
%This generates model predictions in a few different ways!
%
%There are two free parameters in this model: the base rates of mentioning
%S/V/O, and the expected value for the 'number of possible verbs' the 
%model is presumed to be assuming. 
%
%We set both of these parameters empirically, taking the human data split/
%half and setting/testing on opposite halves, twice. 
%
%Four models are compared here:
%
%A model that does not consider context, but just generates words at the
%baserate that that element is mentioned overall. The dummy model. 
%
%A "deterministic" model that uses success/failure to decide what to say:
%it generates 2-word utterances, checks whether any uniquely 
%identify the intended meaning in context, and emits those, or a random one if none 
%qualifies, using the baserates for each word. This model always includes the
%verb. 
%
%The 'informativity' model: From the array of subject, verbs, objects it generates
%the full hypothesis set of possible events.  It then generates two words
%without replacement, based on the number of possible scenarios that each
%word limits us to (fewer scenarios are better)
%
%The 'informativity + base' model does the same, but p(produce) =
%p(baserate) * p(informative)
%
%To compare to how the humans did it, given a context + model, I will get back 
%the probability that a speaker will choose a particular 2-word combo, then
%marginalize to get p(utterance includes word) for each of S,V,O

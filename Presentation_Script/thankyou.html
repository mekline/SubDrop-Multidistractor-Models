<h3> Thank you for your participation in this experiment! </h3>

<p class="blocktext"> This study is part of a larger project exploring how children decide what to say as they are learning to talk.  Children's first
sentences are short, much like the responses you gave in this task.  We will be comparing the responses you and other Mechanical Turk participants gave
to what toddlers say in a very similar task.  We hope this will help us understand the strategies kids use to communicate as they are learning to talk.</p>
